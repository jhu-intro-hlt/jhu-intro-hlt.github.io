851,Drake,Come Winter,Room for Improvement,2006,2006-02-14,drake talking yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen   drake i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this i'm kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right uh ya man it's what it is   drake and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on 'em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i'm still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  4 drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face the breast the bras the toes i'm still  and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  voice strolling in the park and

1068,Drake,ESPYs Conference Call,,2014,2014-07-11,connor shell  youre so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show

1165,BTS (방탄소년단),Love Yourself: 轉 Tear Notes,LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘Tear’,2018,2018-05-18,seokjin 0 august year   can anyone remember the moment they fall in love can anyone predict the moment their love will end what could be the reason that humans dont have the ability to recognize those moments and why was i given the power to return all of those things  the car came to a sudden stop the headlights flash crashing bouncing falling i did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments i heard no sound and felt no sensations it was summer but the wind seemed cold there was the sound of something tumbling along the street then there was the scent of flowers only then did a sense of reality come to me the bouquet of smeraldo flowers fell from my hand she was laying there in the middle of the street there was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair the dark red blood flowers along the street i thought if only i could turn back time  seokjin  july year 0  past the school doors the sound of cicadas prickled my ears the school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races it was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering i ducked my head and walked in between them i wanted to leave as quickly as i could  hyung i lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someones shoulder it was hoseok and jimin they looked at me their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief today is the start of vacation are you still going to leave hoseok asked tugging at my arm i muttered sure and a few more meaningless words then turned my head away what had happened that day was clearly an accident it wasnt intentional i hadnt imagined that jungkook and yoongi would be in the storage room at that time the principal suspected that i was covering for my dangsaengs i had to say something but in the end yoongi had gotten expelled nobody knew that i had been the complicit  have a good vacation hyung ill call you maybe having interpreted my expression hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting i couldnt answer this time either there was nothing i could say as i passed the school gate i thought of the first day i had come to this school we had all been punished  for tardiness together we could laugh because of it i had ruined these moments  yoongi 5 june year   i wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head not how much i had drunk nor where i was nor what i had been doing i didnt know and it wasnt important when i went outside stumbling it was already night i swayed as i walked i bumped into pedestrians news kiosks walls i didnt care i just wanted to forget everything  jimins voice was still ringing in my ears hyung jungkook my next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps the hospital hall had been strangely long and dark i passed people wearing hospital gowns my heart pounded everyones faces were too pale they had no expressions they all seemed like dead people the sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head  inside the slightly opened hospital room door jungkook was lying there i turned my head without realizing it i couldnt look at him at that moment i suddenly heard the sound of a piano of flames of a building crumbling down i clutched my head and sank down this is your fault if it wasnt for you it was my mothers voice no my voice no someones voice at those words i was tormented by countless moments i wanted to believe it wasnt so but jungkook was lying there jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by i was utterly unable to go inside i couldnt check for myself when i stood my legs threatened to give out i left with tears flowing it was funny i couldnt even remember the last time i had cried  i went to cross the street but someone grabbed my arm and i came to a halt who was it no i didnt care no matter who it was it was all the same dont come near me go away just leave me be i dont want to hurt you either i dont want to be hurt so please dont come any closer  yoongi  june year 9  i thoughtlessly ditched school but truthfully i didnt have anywhere to go it was hot i had no money and i had nothing to do it was namjoon who said we should go to the beach the younger kids seemed excited but i didnt particularly feel like it nor did i dislike the idea do we have money at my question namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets a few coins a few bills so we cant go the one who said we could just walk was probably taehyung namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk i wasnt in the mood to talk back so i just fell behind it was midday so even the gingko trees couldnt provide shade and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road  lets go there it was taehyung this time too or was it hoseok i didnt care so i didnt look carefully but it would have been one of them i had been walking along with my head down kicking dirt when i almost collided with someone i lifted my head jimin was standing there as if frozen in place the muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying he was staring at a sign that said flowering arboretum  kilometers  i didnt want to walk i heard jungkooks voice sweat dripped from jimins face he went pale as if he might collapse at any second what is it i had a strange feeling park jimin i called but as i expected he didnt budge i lifted my head again and looked at the sign  hey its so hot why would we go to an arboretum lets go to the beach i said as if dragging my feet i didnt know what kind of place the arboretum was but it didnt seem like we should go whatever the reason jimins expression was strange we dont even have money hoseok replied thats why were walking and taehyung added if we just walk to the train station we can probably make it then namjoons said instead well just starve at dinner jungkook and taehyung pretended to cry and seokjin hyung laughed jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling jimin seemed like a small child i looked up at the sign again the characters spelling flowering arboretum were gradually getting further away  namjoon  july year   i rested my head against the bus window from the library to the gas station the scenery passed by the window almost frighteningly familiar since i took this route everyday would there come a day i could leave this scenery behind i felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring nor to hope for anything  there was a woman sitting in front of me her hair tied with a yellow rubber band her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing then she rested her head against the window for around a month already we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop we hadnt spoken a word to each other but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs the hair tie was still in my pants pocket  the woman always got off the bus three stops before i did every time i saw her leave i wondered if she was going to distribute fliers what kind of time was she spending what kind of things was she enduring how strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow i thought things like that  the womans stop began to approach someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats but in the midst of this that woman didnt stir she just stayed in her seat her head against the window it seemed like she was asleep should i go and wake her i fought with myself for a moment the bus approached the stop the woman didnt move people disembarked the door closed and the bus started to move  the woman didnt wake even as we passed the next three stops as i moved to the bus door i fought with myself again it was clear that once i got off the bus no one else would pay attention to her she would wake up somewhere far from her stop and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it  i left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station the bus took off and i didnt look back i had left the hair tie on top of her bag but that was it that wasnt a beginning and as such nor was it an end it was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything so i thought it really didnt matter  namjoon 7 december year   the people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold i looked down at the dirt clutching the strap of my bag i was trying to not make eye contact with anyone it was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day from a distance i saw the first bus approaching  i boarded the bus behind everyone else i didnt look back when i was passionate about something when i barely had something in my grasp when i had nothing left but things to escape i had conditions i wasnt to look back the moment i looked back the efforts id made until now became little more than seafoam looking back that was a kind of suspicion a kind of lingering attachment and a kind of fear only when i had overcome these things could i finally escape  the bus started off i had no plans i had nothing i was passionate about nothing in my group no particular reason to escape it was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mothers tired face my wandering sibling my fathers illness starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day from my family who enforced sacrifice and tranquility and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned but most of all it was closer to running from poverty  if anyone asked if its a crime to be poor everyone would say its not but is that really the truth poverty gnaws on so many things things that were precious become meaningless you give up things you cant give up you grow suspicious and fearful and resigned  the bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours when i left from that place a year ago i had left no message behind and now i was returning with no sign or warning i tried to recall my friends faces i had cut off contact with all of them what were they all doing these days would they be glad to see me would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then there was frost on the windows and i couldnt see the scenery outside on top of the frost i slowly moved my finger  i have to survive  hoseok 4 july year   i stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid even though it was night the hospital hallway was bustling with people moisture dripped from my hair wet with sweat and rain i dropped the bag i had taken off of her a variety of things tumbled out of it a few coins rolled away and a ball pen and a towel in the middle of it all was an airplane eticket i picked it up and scanned it  at that moment the doctor called me he said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about and after a moment she came out as well are you okay she said that her head just hurt a little and she took her bag from me then she spotted the eticket peeking out and looked up at my face i shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go pretending that it was nothing as we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever we stood side by side outside the door  hoseokah she said it looked like she had something to say wait a second ill get an umbrella i ran off thoughtlessly into the rain there was a convenience store in the distance i knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago the plane ticket meant that she had made it i didnt want to hear her say it i didnt have the confidence to congratulate her  hoseok  july year 0  when i counted to three i heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination the next moment the young me passed by holding someones hand i looked back quickly but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me hoseokah the teacher called my name only then did i realize where i was it was a class field trip i was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook five six i kept counting but as i did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty the memory of that time kept surfacing  i couldnt clearly remember my mothers face that day i only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park hoseokah count to ten and then open your eyes when i had finished counting and opened my eyes my mother was gone i waited and waited but she never returned i had only counted to nine if i counted one more it would have been fine but my voice wouldnt come out my ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy the teacher kept pointing telling me to keep counting my friends were staring at me i couldnt remember my mothers face it seemed like if i counted one more my mother would really never come back for me  just like that i collapsed to the ground  jimin 4 july year   by the time i returned to my senses i had washed my arm so much that i was losing skin my hands were trembling and i was short of breath my eyes were bloodshot what had just happened came back to me in fragments  for a moment i had lost focus i was dancing with a noona from the dance club a collaborative dance but i had lost my flow and we collided i fell to the rough floor and my arm started to bleed at that moment i had remembered what happened at the flowering arboretum i thought that i had overcome it but that wasnt the case i had to run away i had to wash it away i had to look away the me in the mirror was the same eightyearold kid who had run away in the rain then all at once i realized noona had fallen down too  there was nothing i could do all i could do was fall and hurt someone leave them behind and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping every time i took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers car headlights passes me by it wasnt okay no it was okay it didnt hurt it wasnt that serious of an injury i was really okay  jimin 9 may year   in the end i had to go to the flowering arboretum i had quit telling myself the lie that i didnt remember what happened there i had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures if i wanted to do that i had to go to the place with that intent i went to the bus stop every day but i couldnt ride the bus to the arboretum  yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after id already let three buses go by i asked what was up and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do then he asked why i was sitting here like this i thought about why i was sitting here like this it was because i had no courage i wanted to pretend i was okay now that i knew a little that i surpassed it on my own but in truth i was afraid i was afraid that i might encounter something that i might not withstand that i might have another seizure  yoongi hyung looked relaxed he slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him and said that the weather was nice said all kinds of useless things after i heard that i realized the weather really was nice i had been so worried that i didnt bother looking at my surroundings the sky was so blue a warm breeze blew on occasion from far off the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming the bus stopped and the door opened the driver looked at me on impulse i spoke  hyung do you want to come with me  taehyung 7 july year   my side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing sweat fell in drops in the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass the girl was nowhere to be found i had even run to the bus stop but as expected i didnt see her the people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely what had happened we hadnt promised to meet but it was still strange that girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around even if i told her it was annoying it was no use but now she was nowhere to be found even in the places we used to go together  i came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps there was graffiti there we had drawn together it was the first thing she had ever drawn on top of it there was a large x drawn it was her i hadnt seen her do it but i knew why there was no response instead several after images overlapped on the wall  her laughing at me after i had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head her helping me up after id fallen trying to help her run away her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window her gaze following the students we passed by unbeknownst even to her as we had sprayed this wall together i had said if you have a problem tell me about it dont just grumble to yourself the x was drawn over all of those memories it seemed like it was saying all of it was fake i had made my hands into fists why of course there was no response i kept walking we were alone again me and her  taehyung 0 march year 0  i slid down the hallway my feet making noisy sounds then i stopped i could see namjoon standing in front of our classroom our classroom nobody knew this but i called that place our classroom me and the hyungs and jungkook it was ours i caught my breath and approached i was going to startle them  principal i had barely taken five steps when i head an urgent voice through the open classroom window it seemed like seokjin hyung i stopped walking was seokjin hyung talking to the principal right now in our classroom why then i heard my name and yoongi hyungs and i saw namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath as if having sensed it seokjin hyung suddenly opened the door there was a phone in seokjin hyungs hand his shock and confusion was plain on his face i couldnt see namjoon hyungs expression i hid and watched seokjin hyung looked confused hyung must have had a reason after he spoke namjoon hyung passed by seokjin hyung and went into the classroom i couldnt believe it seokjin hyung told the principal what yoongi hyung and i had done for the last several days he told everything about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids but namjoon hyung said that was all okay  what are you doing here i turned around in shock it was hoseok hyung and jimin hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked then slung his arm over my shoulders in a moment of confusion i let hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom namjoon hyung and seokjin hyung were talking and they looked up seokjin hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up he left the classroom i looked at namjoon hyungs expression he had watched seokjin hyungs retreating back but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong at that moment a thought occurred to me namjoon hyung must have had a reason because hyung knew more than me and was smarter and older and because this was our classroom i went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile i thought that i wouldnt tell anyone else that i had overheard that conversation  jungkook 6 july year   i sneakily broke a flower off the hospitals wreath i kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it the midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright i knocked on the hospital room door but there was no reply i knocked again no one was there it was only full of a very quiet darkness  i left the hospital room i had met her here when i was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway she had appeared so suddenly that i barely had time to stop and there she stood a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail when i left the hospital i saw a bench i remembered we had listened to music together and drawn sitting there i was still holding the wildflower in my hand there was no one to give it to  jungkook 0 september year 0  jeon jungkook youre not still going there are you i didnt answer i just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes when i didnt answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file but even so i didnt open my mouth it was the classroom i used with the hyungs after the day i had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom there wasnt a single day i hadnt gone maybe the hyungs didnt know sometimes they didnt come because they had other plans or were busy with parttime jobs i hadnt seen either seokjin hyung or yoongi hyung in a few days but not me i didnt skip a single day there were days when nobody came at all but that's okay even if it wasnt today then they would come tomorrow and if not tomorrow then the day after it was okay  you only learned bad things following them around he hit me again i lifted my gaze and looked at him he hit me again the image came to me of yoongi hyung hitting me i gritted my teeth and endured i didnt want to lie and say i hadnt been going  now i was standing again in front of that classroom it seemed like the hyungs would be there if i opened the door it seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why i was so late seokjin hyung and namjoon hyung would be reading books yoongi hyung would be playing the piano and hoseok hyung and jimin hyung would be dancing  but when i opened the door only hoseok hyung was there he was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom i held the door handle and just stood there hyung came over and put his arm around my shoulders then he led me outside lets go the classroom door closed behind us i suddenly realized those days were gone and they would never return

1480,Billie Eilish,Paparazzi Instagram Monologue,,2019,2019-11-22,so i just wanted to say something real quick which is yesterday i was at kimmel which was amazing and when i left i had to go to a rehearsal so to walk to the car there was an alley that i walked through like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans and then like 500 feet to my right was what i thought was fans and paparazzi  i started i went to the left side i walked all the way over to them and hugged them all i took pictures and talked to them for a second didn't sign anything because i like don't do that that's something i don't do because i used to and i realised all anyone did was sell everything that i signed so i stopped doing that it's kind of a policy of mine that i don't  so i talked to them hugged them all i went to the other side and as i got closer like they were cheering for me and stuff and shouting for my name and stuff and so i walked  and as i got closer i kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all  but i didn't want to like be disrespectful at all so i went up to them all and i like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever and i started to do that nobody put their hands out nobody tried to hug me backi hugged one girl at the end and so she was really sweet  but then i tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were not where the first group was but like in the same area that i was in because i thought that's where there were fans  when i looked over there they were gone and i was like ok well i guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph which i don't do because these bitches will sell that shit  like i'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever of course i'm gonna do that but i have this whole thing about not signing things because i just want to be there i'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit  i don't do that and i've tried to make that clear like a billion times  and i said it before i went over to them  anyway  i started to walk away because i realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person um and so i walked away  as i started to walk away back to the car they all started to boo me  and then they all started calling me a little bitch and saying i'm gonna lose my grammy nominations and you know what a little fucking you know whatever just cursing me out and shit  damn dude like  then i started hearing them comparing they kept being like lorde would have stopped i'm like i did stop i walked 500 fe i walked like 000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch  like the fact that people can switch up like that clicks fingersdamn like wait outside for you and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and fucking curse at you  i'm like bro i'm 7 you're  oh my god this shit isexasperated whoo i turned around ready to fucking pounce and then i got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction which is probably good and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but  mmanyway the only reason i'm making this video is because i saw a video of this all happening and i just wanted to clarify what actually happened because if you watch the video it literally looks like i'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them which is not at all what happened  i literally walked from the other side of the alley which was like 000 feet which is fine i'm like happy to do it but i walked over there literally only to say hi only to hug people i literally went over and i was like i don't want pictures i want to hug and i got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face and no love whatsoever  so i left and then i got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that i'm gonna lose my grammys  i probably am gonna lose the grammys but it's okay though i'm not worried about that it's the nomination that counts  anyway i don't know i just wanted to i don't even knowi went back to the other side where the real fans were and i was like guys they booed me and they were very sweet you guys are my friends i love you a lot  and to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch i hope the best for you i hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle so yeah all the best  love you paparazzi

3069,Beyoncé,“Self-Titled” Part 2 . Imperfection,,,,there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message

the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone  watching blue planet creating new habits then as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just reevaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in a day we'll have to say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina uh won't you leave me now now  love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both in a road won't you leave me now now
3610,Ed Sheeran,Take It Back (SBTV extended version),,2014,2014-04-25,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signs of a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paper weight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song this is like claiming i handled it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i have it this song's from the heart cover the planet i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no and take it back now  now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhymes 'til i deliver the hype am i just living the lie with this you must know that the number's just sold whoa will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 per cent of it when we wake but the other 0 per cent it never fades dreaming dreams day to day goals stay awake loads try to make the cut like the paper or razor blade oh never give up and just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me buskin' on the street when it was cold outdoors and now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pulses little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams you own just set your goals and have the utmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha

4182,Taylor Swift,Reputation [Prologue],reputation,2017,2017-11-10,here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

4278,Taylor Swift,Lover [Foreword],,2019,2019-08-23,when i found old diaries from my childhood and my teens they were covered in dust i'm not just saying that for poetic effect they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes i used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments i'd practice my autograph and tape my  picks to the pages in the entries i daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous i was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game i frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love friends confidence and trust i vented described memories in detail jotted down new song ideas and questioned why i would ever try to shoot for a career i had such a small chance of ever attaining  but what shocked me the most was how often i wrote down the things i loved writing a new song riding in the car with my mom the purplepink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting the dazzle of opal necklaces i couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case i wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such wonderment intrigue romance i noticed things and decided they were romantic and so they were  in life we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be how to act or how to be happy like invisible smoke in the room we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life we constantly question our choices our surroundings and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes all the while we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love  i've decided that in this life i want to be defined by the things i love not the things i hate the things i'm afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but they're not my identity i wish the same for you may your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you turn those voices up in the mix in your head may you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didn't i hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed i hope that if there is a lover in your life it's someone who deserves you if that's the case i hope you treat them with care  this album is a love letter to love itself all the captivating spellbinding maddening devastating red blue gray golden aspects of it that's why there are so many songs in honor of fever dreams bad boys confessions of love on a drunken night out christmas lights still hanging in january  string scars on my hands false gods and blind faith memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light finally finding a friend and opening the curtains to see the clearest brightest daylight after the darkest night  we are what we love this is lover

4525,Taylor Swift,"To Apple, Love Taylor",,2015,2015-06-21,i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor
