\slide{Large Pretrained Model Revolution}
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Train large models on raw text, computer code, or speech
\begin{itemize}
\item large language models (e.g., ChatGPT)
\item large code models (e.g., Code Llama)
\item large speech models (e.g., Whisper)
\end{itemize}
\item Use them directly for language tasks
\begin{itemize}
\item "emergent behavior", "zero-shot", "reasoning"
\item may require clever prompt design
\end{itemize}
\item Adapt them to tasks
\begin{itemize}
\item instruction fine-tuning
\item reinforcement learning from human feedback
\item workflows that include traditional symbolic processing ("agents")
\end{itemize}

\slide{Convergence of Methods}
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Text, speech, and vision increasingly use similar methods\\
(variants of deep learning with Transformer model)
\item Trend towards integrating them into a single model
\item  Still many challenges
\begin{itemize}
\item different sets of training data for different modalities
\item size of integrated models makes training expensive
\item what is relevant in speech and vision different from text\\
(emotion, nuance, properties beyond textual meaning)
\item  multilinguality
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Common Themes}
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Hard problems $\rightarrow$ not solved, but {\em good enough} technology
\item Common methods with other subfields of artificial intelligence
\item Technology is advancing rapidly
\item New applications on (and just behind) horizon
\end{itemize}
