****** ANNOUNCING the release of FoilTeX 2.1.4b for LaTeX2e *******
******************************************************************
 
I have recently uploaded the latest release of the FoilTeX system for
generating foils (transparencies, slides) using TeX.  You should find
it on your nearest CTAN in
    /macros/latex/contrib/foiltex

*******************  About the package ***************************
 
  Its features include simplicity of use, compatibility with LaTeX,
  large sans serif font as default, extra macros to start foils with
  bold headings and special mechanisms to control footer and header.
 
This new version (from 2.1.4a to 2.1.4b) fixes an incompatibilty with 
the latest hyperref 6.77a package.
