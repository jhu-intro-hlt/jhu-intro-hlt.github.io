\Question{\Large Dialog Systems}{20}
\vskip .25in
\begin{enumerate}


\item Which (can be none or more than one) of the following are easy for today's conversational agents: [2 pts] 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item question answering
    \item decision support
    \item meeting booking
    \item chitchat
\end{enumerate} 

\item Write down three ethical concerns / considerations regarding conversational agents (a.k.a. chatbots):  [5 pts] 

\item Describe 3 differences between task and non-task driven chatbot evaluation [3 pts] 

\newpage
\item  True or False, if False explain why [10 pts]

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep 5mm
    \item Machine translation is important for Chatbot Evaluation \\[2mm]
    {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item Information Retrieval is important for chatbots.\\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}

    \item Current trends show that chatbots are in decline. \\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item Chitchat is useless and shouldn't be studied.\\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}

    \item Companies are all using neural methods now. \\[2mm]
    {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item Entity linking is important for persona.\\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item Mutual information is important for neural generative chatbot models since this method takes into account the probability of the source given the target and the probability of the target given the source.\\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item The mutual information objective decreases the likelihood of so-called dull responses.\\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    
    \item Chatbots are attempting to include world knowledge, personal knowledge, and persona. This can only be done with transformer models. \\[2mm] 
    {$\square$ True $\square$ False}
    \item Rule-based chatbots are a good choice when starting a project. \\[2mm] {$\square$ True $\square$ False}

    \item Why do we need to ensure that AI algorithms take into account the principle of justice? How could considering fairness in AI affect the algorithm's output? [5 pts]


\item Explain the concept of 'Explicability' in AI ethical principles and how it is related to the other four principles.
